# Use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX to compile.
If you don't have LaTeX installed in your local machine, it is easiest (up to my experience) to use [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
This is an awefully written, but still generates nice looking, job application package: cover letter, CV, reference list, and other statements they require.
